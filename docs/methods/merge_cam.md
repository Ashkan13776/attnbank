# CaM

<p class="tx-regkey"><code>merge_cam</code> &middot; <code>ab.build("merge_cam")</code></p>

**CaM: the token leaving the cache is merged into its neighbours instead of dropped.**

category
:   [`compress`](../taxonomy.md#compress) — one of the seven objects in $y(q)=\int v\,\mathrm{d}\pi_q$ a method can change

objective
:   `approximate` — targets fidelity to dense softmax; judged by output error

class
:   `attnbank.CaMAttention`, [`attnbank/methods/compress/merge_cam.py`](https://github.com/Ashkan13776/attnbank/blob/main/attnbank/methods/compress/merge_cam.py)

monograph
:   `sec:compress`

## What it changes

Changes the stored context $(\mu, k, v)$ itself. This is the one category that routinely perturbs the integrand, so $\widehat v \neq v$ and the error has a value term.

It pursues **approximation**: it is trying to be dense softmax, so it is fair to judge it by output error, and it must supply a correctness anchor saying where it becomes exact.

## In the paper's notation

`sec:compress-evict`, `sec:compress-merge`, `prop:compress-noeviction`.  CaM sits
on a StreamingLLM cache — `sinks` attention sinks plus a recent window of
`recent = budget - sinks` — and asks what to do with the token that falls off the
back of the window.  Eviction throws it away.  CaM writes its value into the next
`merge_window` entries first:

```text
rho_j   = pi(j) / mean_{j < i <= j + recent} pi(i)        (clamped to [0, 1])
g_j     ~ Bernoulli(rho_j)
v_hat_i += g_j v_hat_j / merge_window,   j < i <= j + merge_window
```

`rho_j` is the *prominence* of the departing token relative to the window it is
leaving, so a token nobody looked at is usually dropped and a heavy hitter is usually
carried.  Because `v_hat_j` on the right is the already-merged value, a token that is
carried and then itself evicted cascades further forward; running the loop in
increasing `j` on a mutable value field reproduces that exactly, as the released code
does by mutating `value_states` in place.

**What CaM does and does not preserve.**  Keys are never merged, so the measure is a
plain renormalised restriction: `extras['eps']` is the mass CaM deletes, and setting
`merge_window = 0` — the same method with the repair switched off — deletes it
bit for bit and leaves `v` alone.  What CaM repairs is
the *value field*: `v_hat != v`, and the evicted values survive inside the retained
ones.  This is therefore **not** the pushforward of `merge_kv`, where the mass itself
is carried and `pi_hat` picks up the `log |C_i|` gauge bias; it is a restriction
with a repaired `v_hat`, and `eq:error_decomposition` splits it that way — CaM
leaves the distributional term exactly where eviction left it and attacks the value
term alone.  Saying so is the point: the two repairs are different objects, and
`tests/test_compress_evict.py` measures both.

**Semantics: eviction, with a destructive twist.**  The merge pass is the prefill: the
whole stream is ingested, the cache is reduced to `budget`, and *every* query is then
served from that one reduced, rewritten cache — which is why the method declares
`supports_causal = False`.  The twist is that the damage is worse than hiding in a
way no member of `restrict/` can imitate: `sink_window` leaves `v` untouched, so
a later pass can still read the original values, whereas CaM has overwritten them.
The cache cannot be un-merged.

`mode` defaults to `'expected'`, which uses `rho_j` itself as the gate — the
conditional expectation of the released code's Bernoulli draw.  The bank's conformance
suite requires a method to agree between fp32 and fp64 and between CPU and CUDA, and a
coin flip on a threshold does not; `mode='sample'` reproduces the released sampler
through a seeded `torch.Generator` for anyone who wants the variance.

Exact limit: `budget = None` (nothing leaves the window, nothing is merged).

## What it declares

Each row is a commitment the conformance suite tests, not a description.

<div class="attn-decl" markdown="1">

| attribute | declared | what that commits it to |
|---|---|---|
| `supports_causal` | **no** | `causal=True` raises `CausalNotSupportedError` — a statement about the operator, not a missing feature. |
| `expresses_weights` | **yes** | it can name $\widehat\pi_q$ on the **original** $n$ positions, so it enters the error decomposition. |
| `row_stochastic` | **yes** | those weights are $\ge 0$ and sum to one: $\widehat\pi_q$ is a probability measure. |
| `head_independent` | **yes** | each head is computed from its own $K, V$. |
| `trainable` | **no** | no learned parameters — what you build is what the paper describes. |

</div>

## Configuration

| parameter | default |
|---|---|
| `budget` | `6` |
| `sinks` | `2` |
| `merge_window` | `4` |
| `obs` | `4` |
| `mode` | `'expected'` |
| `seed` | `0` |

`budget` = sinks + recent window; `merge_window` = CaM's `merge_budget`.

```python
ab.describe("merge_cam")     # the same keys, with everything else it declares
```

## Correctness anchor

**Exact limit.** Built with `budget=None` this method provably *is* dense softmax, and `tests/test_conformance.py` asserts it — output and weights, float32 and float64.

```pycon
>>> ab.describe("merge_cam").limit_config
{'budget': None}
```

## Backends

| backend | what it is |
|---|---|
| `reference` | plain PyTorch; the correctness anchor and the default |

**`reference` only, and that is the correct answer.** It reports the omitted mass `eps` (and the $\chi^2$ divergence of the renormalisation) in `extras`, which needs the full score matrix. A kernel that avoids materialising that matrix is a kernel that cannot produce them.

Declaring a backend is a claim that it equals the reference, checked by `tests/test_conformance.py::test_backend_equivalence`; declaring `sdpa` here would be pretending. See [Backends](../backends.md).

Diagnostics returned in `extras`: `assign`, `budget`, `chi2`, `cluster_radius`, `eps`, `k_realized`, `merge_gate`, `merge_window`, `prominence`, `recent`, `retained_idx`, `sinks`, `sizes`, `support`, `v_bar`.

## Cost model

Analytic, per `(batch, head)`, declared by the method itself:

```python
def cost(self, m, n, d, dv, bytes_per_el=2):
    b = max(1, min(self.budget or n, n))
    return {"flops": 2 * m * b * (d + dv) + n * dv,
            "state_bytes": b * (d + dv) * bytes_per_el,
            "bytes_moved": (m * d + m * b * (d + dv) + m * dv) * bytes_per_el}
```

At $m = 1024$, $n = 1024$, $d = 64$, $dv = 64$ and `bytes_per_el=2`, against the reference operator at the same shape:

| quantity | this method | `softmax` | ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `flops` | 1,638,400 | 268,435,456 | 0.0061× |
| `state_bytes` | 1,536 | 262,144 | 0.00586× |
| `bytes_moved` | 1,835,008 | 4,718,592 | 0.389× |

!!! note "A cost model is not a benchmark"
    These are counted operations and resident bytes, not measured time.
    They are what the monograph's capacity arguments are made of;
    `examples/08_cost_and_capacity.py` walks through the comparison properly.

## Run it

```python
import torch, attnbank as ab

torch.manual_seed(0)
b, h, n, d = 1, 2, 64, 32
q, k, v = (torch.randn(b, h, n, d) for _ in range(3))

attn = ab.build("merge_cam", budget=6, sinks=2)
out = attn(q, k, v, causal=False,   # it declares supports_causal = False
           return_weights=True)

print(attn)
print(out)
print("invariant W:", out.check_invariant(v))

# objective = approximate: it targets dense softmax, so it is judged by
# output error -- split into the distributional and value terms.
row = ab.compare(["merge_cam"], q, k, v, causal=False,
                 configs={"merge_cam": {'budget': 6, 'sinks': 2}})[0]
print({key: round(row[key], 5) for key in
       ("output_error", "distributional_error", "value_error", "tv")})
```
