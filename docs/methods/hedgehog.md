# Hedgehog

<p class="tx-regkey"><code>hedgehog</code> &middot; <code>ab.build("hedgehog")</code></p>

**Hedgehog: a feature map *fitted* to the softmax attention it is replacing.**

category
:   [`interaction`](../taxonomy.md#interaction) — one of the seven objects in $y(q)=\int v\,\mathrm{d}\pi_q$ a method can change

objective
:   `approximate` — targets fidelity to dense softmax; judged by output error

class
:   `attnbank.HedgehogAttention`, [`attnbank/methods/interaction/hedgehog.py`](https://github.com/Ashkan13776/attnbank/blob/main/attnbank/methods/interaction/hedgehog.py)

monograph
:   `sec:kernel`

## What it changes

Changes the interaction $g(q,x)$, replaced by a surrogate $\widehat g$. $\pi_q = \widehat g(q,\cdot)\mu / \widehat Z(q)$ is then a different measure on the same $n$ positions.

It pursues **approximation**: it is trying to be dense softmax, so it is fair to judge it by output error, and it must supply a correctness anchor saying where it becomes exact.

## In the paper's notation

`sec:kernel-det`, `sec:kernel-limits`.  Every other entry in this directory picks
`phi` in advance — `exp(omega^T u - ||u||^2/2)`, `elu + 1`, `relu`, `x^2`,
`1 + z + z^2/2` — and then asks how close the induced `pi_hat` lands.  Zhang et
al. (2024) invert the question: fix the separable *form*, learn the map.  Their
diagnosis is that linear attentions fail on two measurable axes, spikiness and
monotonicity of the induced weights, and their feature map is built to restore both,

```text
phi_W(u) = softmax([ W u + b ; -(W u + b) ]) in R^{2r},
```

— an exponential map (spiky) run through a softmax over the feature axis (bounded,
so it never overflows), with the negated copy appended so that the map is monotone in
`<q,k>` in both directions.  Queries and keys get their own `(W, b)`.  The
parameters are then obtained by *distillation*: the paper's Eq. 7 minimises the
cross-entropy between the induced measure and the true one,

```text
L = - sum_i sum_j pi_q_i(j) log pi_hat_q_i(j),
```

which is the KL from softmax to `pi_hat` up to a constant, so the fit is an explicit
projection of softmax onto the rank-`2r` separable family.

This file performs that projection **inside the forward pass**, per `(batch, head)`,
on the tensors it is given, with Adam in float64 from a seeded initialization.  It is
therefore an *oracle* in the sense of `nmf_oracle` and `svd_oracle`: it reports
how well the best feature map of width `2r` that this objective can find does, which
upper-bounds what a deployed Hedgehog achieves after distillation on a corpus.  Two
consequences are declared rather than hidden.  `trainable = True` — the defaults are
not a method, they are an initialization plus a fitting budget.  And
`supports_causal = False`: the fitted `W` depends on the whole attention matrix,
so an early query's output would move when a later key changed.  A deployed Hedgehog
distills once and then runs causally; this one cannot, and saying so is cheaper than
a mask that does not mean what it says.

The anchor is `convergence_configs` over `steps`.  More optimization lowers the
cross-entropy, which lowers the KL, which lowers the output error — monotonically in
the mean, and towards softmax, which no finite budget reaches because the family has
rank `2r`.  `steps = 0` is the untrained random feature map and is the worst point
of the sequence by construction.

## What it declares

Each row is a commitment the conformance suite tests, not a description.

<div class="attn-decl" markdown="1">

| attribute | declared | what that commits it to |
|---|---|---|
| `supports_causal` | **no** | `causal=True` raises `CausalNotSupportedError` — a statement about the operator, not a missing feature. |
| `expresses_weights` | **yes** | it can name $\widehat\pi_q$ on the **original** $n$ positions, so it enters the error decomposition. |
| `row_stochastic` | **yes** | those weights are $\ge 0$ and sum to one: $\widehat\pi_q$ is a probability measure. |
| `head_independent` | **yes** | each head is computed from its own $K, V$. |
| `trainable` | **yes** | it has learned parameters; the reference implementation initialises them from a seed, so the numbers here are an untrained operator. |

</div>

## Configuration

| parameter | default |
|---|---|
| `r` | `None` |
| `steps` | `100` |
| `lr` | `0.05` |
| `seed` | `0` |

`r` feature directions (`2r` features); `None` means the head dim `d`.

```python
ab.describe("hedgehog")     # the same keys, with everything else it declares
```

## Correctness anchor


**Convergence anchor.** There is no finite resource at which this method is exact, so the anchor is monotonicity instead: the mean error against `softmax` must decrease along these configs, and the suite fails if it does not.

```pycon
>>> ab.get_class("hedgehog").convergence_configs()
[{'steps': 0}, {'steps': 20}, {'steps': 80}, {'steps': 320}]
```

## Backends

| backend | what it is |
|---|---|
| `reference` | plain PyTorch; the correctness anchor and the default |

**`reference` only, and that is the correct answer.** `sdpa` computes exactly $\mathrm{softmax}(\beta\langle q,k\rangle + \text{mask})\,v$; this operator replaces $g$, so it is not that expression and there is no kernel for it.

Declaring a backend is a claim that it equals the reference, checked by `tests/test_conformance.py::test_backend_equivalence`; declaring `sdpa` here would be pretending. See [Backends](../backends.md).

Diagnostics returned in `extras`: `Z_hat`, `cross_entropy`, `g_hat`, `phi_k`, `phi_q`, `r`, `steps`.

## Cost model

Analytic, per `(batch, head)`, declared by the method itself:

```python
def cost(self, m, n, d, dv, bytes_per_el=2):
    r = 2 * (self.r or d)
    return {"flops": 2 * (m + n) * r * d + 2 * n * r * dv + 2 * m * r * dv,
            "state_bytes": r * (dv + 1) * bytes_per_el,
            "bytes_moved": (m * d + n * (d + dv) + m * dv + r * (dv + 1)) * bytes_per_el}
```

At $m = 1024$, $n = 1024$, $d = 64$, $dv = 64$ and `bytes_per_el=2`, against the reference operator at the same shape:

| quantity | this method | `softmax` | ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `flops` | 67,108,864 | 268,435,456 | 0.25× |
| `state_bytes` | 16,640 | 262,144 | 0.0635× |
| `bytes_moved` | 540,928 | 4,718,592 | 0.115× |

!!! note "A cost model is not a benchmark"
    These are counted operations and resident bytes, not measured time.
    They are what the monograph's capacity arguments are made of;
    `examples/08_cost_and_capacity.py` walks through the comparison properly.

## Run it

```python
import torch, attnbank as ab

torch.manual_seed(0)
b, h, n, d = 1, 2, 64, 32
q, k, v = (torch.randn(b, h, n, d) for _ in range(3))

attn = ab.build("hedgehog", steps=100, lr=0.05)
out = attn(q, k, v, causal=False,   # it declares supports_causal = False
           return_weights=True)

print(attn)
print(out)
print("invariant W:", out.check_invariant(v))

# objective = approximate: it targets dense softmax, so it is judged by
# output error -- split into the distributional and value terms.
row = ab.compare(["hedgehog"], q, k, v, causal=False,
                 configs={"hedgehog": {'steps': 100, 'lr': 0.05}})[0]
print({key: round(row[key], 5) for key in
       ("output_error", "distributional_error", "value_error", "tv")})
```

```text

AttentionOutput(y=[1, 2, 64, 32], weights=[1, 2, 64, 64], v_hat=None, extras=[Z_hat, cross_entropy, g_hat, phi_k, phi_q, r, steps], dtype=float32, device=cpu)

{'output_error': 0.19257, 'distributional_error': 0.19257, 'value_error': 0.0, 'tv': 0.09522}
```
