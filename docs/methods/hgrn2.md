# HGRN2

<p class="tx-regkey"><code>hgrn2</code> &middot; <code>ab.build("hgrn2")</code></p>

**HGRN2: a gated *vector* recurrence expanded to a matrix state by an outer product.**

category
:   [`recurrent`](../taxonomy.md#recurrent) — one of the seven objects in $y(q)=\int v\,\mathrm{d}\pi_q$ a method can change

objective
:   `modify` — defines a different operator; fidelity to softmax is not the goal

class
:   `attnbank.HGRN2Attention`, [`attnbank/methods/recurrent/hgrn2.py`](https://github.com/Ashkan13776/attnbank/blob/main/attnbank/methods/recurrent/hgrn2.py)

monograph
:   `sec:memory-state`

## What it changes

Changes the operator. $y$ is produced by a finite-state recurrence over positions rather than by an integral against a measure — though it is still linear in $v$, which is why the weights can be recovered at all.

It pursues **modification**: it defines a *different* operator. Asking how closely it approximates softmax is asking the wrong question — it is not trying to.

## In the paper's notation

`sec:memory-state`, `tab:memory-recurrences`.  HGRN is an element-wise gated RNN,

```text
h_t = f_t * h_{t-1} + (1 - f_t) * i_t,                     h_t in R^d,
```

whose state is a *vector*: `prop:memory-rank` caps what it can recall at `d`
numbers however wide the layer is.  HGRN2 changes one symbol — the element-wise
product becomes an outer product —

```text
H_t = Diag(f_t) H_{t-1} + (1 - f_t) v_t^T,                 H_t in R^{d x d_v},
y_hat_t = H_t^T q_t,
```

and the state becomes a matrix of `d x d_v` numbers at exactly the same parameter
count.  In the vocabulary of this category that is GLA with the key *tied to the gate*,
`k_t = 1 - f_t` and `alpha_t = f_t`: HGRN2 has no separate key projection at all,
which is the point — the expansion is free.

Two consequences worth stating, because they are what distinguishes this row from GLA.

*Per channel the write is a convex combination.*  Summing the unrolled recurrence
channel by channel, `sum_{j <= t} (1 - f_j) prod_{u > j} f_u = 1 - prod_{u <= t} f_u
<= 1`.  So the state cannot grow without bound in `t`, and the weights

```text
w_{tj} = sum_r q_{t,r} (1 - f_{j,r}) prod_{u = j+1}^{t} f_{u,r}
```

have row sum `<q_t, 1 - prod_{u <= t} f_u>` — bounded, readable, and equal to one
only by accident.  Boundedness without normalization again (`sec:memory-state`); the
rows are not a probability measure and the operator declares
`row_stochastic = False`.

*The lower bound is where "hierarchical" lives.*  HGRN sets
`f_t = gamma + (1 - gamma) sigmoid(.)` and makes `gamma` increase monotonically
with depth (via `cumax` over layers), so lower layers forget fast and model local
structure while upper layers approach `f = 1` and carry long-range state.  A single
operator cannot be hierarchical on its own; `lower_bound=` is that layer's `gamma`,
and sweeping it from 0 to 1 traces the depth axis of the real model.  At
`lower_bound=1` the gate is stuck open, nothing is ever written (`1 - f = 0`) and
the output is exactly zero — the degenerate end of the schedule, reported rather than
clamped away.

## What it declares

Each row is a commitment the conformance suite tests, not a description.

<div class="attn-decl" markdown="1">

| attribute | declared | what that commits it to |
|---|---|---|
| `supports_causal` | **yes** | `causal=True` masks so query $i$ sees keys $0 \dots i + (n-m)$. |
| `expresses_weights` | **yes** | it can name $\widehat\pi_q$ on the **original** $n$ positions, so it enters the error decomposition. |
| `row_stochastic` | **no** | the weights are **not** a probability measure — signed, or not summing to one — so the output can leave the convex hull of the values. |
| `head_independent` | **yes** | each head is computed from its own $K, V$. |
| `trainable` | **no** | no learned parameters — what you build is what the paper describes. |

</div>

## Configuration

| parameter | default |
|---|---|
| `lower_bound` | `0.9` |
| `gate_bias` | `0.0` |
| `normalize` | `False` |
| `state_rank` | `None` |

`lower_bound`: this layer's `gamma` in `f = gamma + (1 - gamma) sigmoid`.

It is the hierarchical schedule's one free number — 0 at the bottom of the
stack, approaching 1 at the top; the default sits mid-stack, because at 0 the
untrained gate averages one half and the state keeps barely a token.
`state_rank` truncates the gate/key dimension and so *is* the size of the
recurrent state, `state_rank x d_v`.

```python
ab.describe("hgrn2")     # the same keys, with everything else it declares
```

## Correctness anchor

**None, and that is the declaration.** `objective = modify` means this is a different operator, not an approximation of softmax, so neither anchor applies. The conformance suite does not skip the check — it *asserts the exemption*, requiring `limit_config()` and `convergence_configs()` to both be `None` for a `modify` method.

## Backends

| backend | what it is |
|---|---|
| `reference` | plain PyTorch; the correctness anchor and the default |

**`reference` only, and that is the correct answer.** A scan over positions with a fixed-size state is a different program from a masked softmax.

Declaring a backend is a claim that it equals the reference, checked by `tests/test_conformance.py::test_backend_equivalence`; declaring `sdpa` here would be pretending. See [Backends](../backends.md).

Diagnostics returned in `extras`: `forget_gate`, `input_gate`, `lower_bound`, `mass`, `state_rank`.

## Cost model

Analytic, per `(batch, head)`, declared by the method itself:

```python
def cost(self, m, n, d, dv, bytes_per_el=2):
    r = self.state_rank or d
    # no key projection: the gate is the key, so the per-step gate work is the
    # only extra over the additive recurrence.
    return recurrent_cost(m, n, r, dv, bytes_per_el, gate_flops=3)
```

At $m = 1024$, $n = 1024$, $d = 64$, $dv = 64$ and `bytes_per_el=2`, against the reference operator at the same shape:

| quantity | this method | `softmax` | ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `flops` | 16,973,824 | 268,435,456 | 0.0632× |
| `state_bytes` | 8,192 | 262,144 | 0.0312× |
| `bytes_moved` | 524,288 | 4,718,592 | 0.111× |

!!! note "A cost model is not a benchmark"
    These are counted operations and resident bytes, not measured time.
    They are what the monograph's capacity arguments are made of;
    `examples/08_cost_and_capacity.py` walks through the comparison properly.

## Run it

```python
import torch, attnbank as ab

torch.manual_seed(0)
b, h, n, d = 1, 2, 64, 32
q, k, v = (torch.randn(b, h, n, d) for _ in range(3))

attn = ab.build("hgrn2", lower_bound=0.9, gate_bias=0.0)
out = attn(q, k, v, causal=True,
           return_weights=True)

print(attn)
print(out)
print("invariant W:", out.check_invariant(v))

# objective = modify: this is a different operator and fidelity to softmax
# is not its goal, so there is no error to quote. What it *is* doing shows
# up in its own diagnostics.
print("row_stochastic =", attn.row_stochastic, "| first row sums:",
      [round(x, 4) for x in out.weights.sum(-1)[0, 0, :4].tolist()])
print("extras:", sorted(out.extras))
```
